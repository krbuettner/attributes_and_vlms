# Investigating the Role of Attribute Context in Vision-Language Models for Object Recognition and Detection (WACV 2024)

![Intro Image](files/intro_fig.png)

This repo currently has code for our proposed text-region retrieval task.

To prep, please install:
- CLIP
- [OpenCLIP](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip)
- PyTorch

And download:
- COCO 2017
- [OVAD](https://ovad-benchmark.github.io/)

Our trained CLIP models are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pgeqKt-U0O0Gh3qhhuKUs6CToW-2DiAV?usp=drive_link).

More code to come!
